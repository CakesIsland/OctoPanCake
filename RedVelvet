Red Velvet is an amazing cake, with a flavour of chocolate, and etc.
Still, I can't be convinced that there is a better desert than a cake. Cake is good.This is nice, Github is cool.
Isn't it ?Ahead of time, bro. Ahead.What ?
What is happening man ?It's a bit confusing without a proper documentation/tutorial.
but it's cool.

This is created by a new branch, to see how the commits are going. Guess it's all good for now.
Have a nice day.
